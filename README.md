# JSON & Pickle Serialization in Python

This project demonstrates how to use Python's `json` and `pickle` modules to:

- Serialize and deserialize Python dictionaries
- Write to and read from `.json` and `.pkl` files
- Understand the difference between JSON (human-readable) and Pickle (Python-native)

## 📂 Function: `process_json`

Located in `main.py`, this function:

- Takes a dictionary and filename
- Serializes the dictionary to a JSON file
- Deserializes it back into a Python object
- Returns the result

## 💡 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external packages needed

## 🏁 How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```
